How to create or edit a board of conversation?
----------------------------------------------

When you first access the "Your Conversations" item in the "Conversations" menu, you will be asked to create a "Board" of conversations, that is, a way to organize and group similar conversations. Click "Create a new board" to start creating your first board of conversations.

* Enter a short identifier, with no accents and no spaces, because your identified is used in the formation of the web address to list the conversations contained in this table. Example: education, youth-actions, soccer-hall, etc.

* Insert a title for your board, avoid using a very long title.

* Give a brief description of your board conversation. In this space you can comment on the proposal of the conversations grouped in this table.


What are public conversations?

You can participate in public conversations by registering your opinion with comments and votes.

URL structure
=============

This document register the default URLs used in the platform and where to find
them in their corresponding apps.

Both login and register views accept a ?next=<url> tag that controls the
redirect page.

    must confirm in order to actually remove the account.

Profile views
-------------

Users cannot see each other's profiles since EJ is not meant to be a traditional
social network. There is no concept of "friends", "followers",
"private conversations" etc.

    Edit profile.

notifications in the system.

EJ Platform
===========


You can visit EJ website at https://www.ejplatform.org.
For detailed information on developing and using our system, you can access our documentation on:
https://www.ejplatform.org/docs/.
For contributions, issues or feature requests join us on https://gitlab.com/pencillabs/ej/ej-application

Getting started
===============

Local development (Docker)
------------------------------

First clone the repository::

    $ git clone https://gitlab.com/pencillabs/ej/ej-application
    $ cd ej-application

The recomended way to run EJ is with Docker. With it
you can quickly start the development server using the
commands::

    $ pip3 install invoke==2.0.0 --user
    $ inv docker-build
    $ inv docker-up

This will deploy EJ using **docker/docker-compose.yml** file.
Every change made on the repository will be reflected inside the
`docker_server` container.

If you are creating a clean EJ instance, you can populate the database
with some fake data::

    $ inv docker-exec "poetry run inv db-fake"

You can access the running instance accessing `http://localhost:8000`.

To rebuild the server image, you can run `inv docker-build --no-cache`.

Some useful commands to manage docker environment:

==================                      =============================================
Command                                 Description
==================                      =============================================
inv docker-up                           Creates EJ containers and run the application
inv docker-logs                         Shows django logs
inv docker-stop                         Stops EJ containers
inv docker-rm                           Removes EJ containers
inv docker-attach                       Connects to django container
inv docker-exec                         Executes a command on django container
inv docker-exec "poetry run inv docs"   Compile .rst documentation
==================                      =============================================

Some useful commands to manage the application **(run this inside django container)**:

===========================  ======================================================
Command                      Description
===========================  ======================================================
poetry run inv i18n          Extracts messages from Jinja templates for translation
poetry run inv i18n -c       Compile .po files
poetry run inv sass          Compile sass files
poetry run inv sass --watch  Watch changes on code, and compile .sass files
poetry run inv collect       Moves compiled files (css, js) to Django static folder
poetry run inv db            Prepare database and run migrations
poetry run inv shell         Executs django shell with ipython
===========================  ======================================================


Tests
-----

If you are making changes to EJ codebase, do not forget to run tests frequently.
EJ uses Pytest_::

    $ inv docker-test

Docker bash
-----------

You probably will want to execute commands inside the container.
It is possible to open a bash shell in the main "web" container with::

    $ inv docker-attach

You also can execute commands without open docker bash shell::

    $ inv docker-exec "command"

Documentation
-------------

After configuring local environment, the next step is reading our documentation. It can be generated with::

    $ inv docker-exec "poetry run inv docs"

and will be available at the `http://localhost:8000/docs <http://localhost:8000/docs>`_ url.
